Continuous integration:

Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice that requires developers to integrate code into a shared repository several times a day. Each check-in is then verified by an automated build, allowing teams to detect problems early. 
By integrating regularly, you can detect errors quickly, and locate them more easily.

Continuous Delivery:

Continuous Delivery is a natural extension of continuous integration it is a deployment practice where you can put your build packages on testing environment (mock server). so team ensures that every change to the system is releasable and release any version with the push of a button.

Here we can deliver frequently and get quick feedback on what users care about.

Continuous Deployment:

After continuous delivery once teams ensures release then they deploy that release on production .
